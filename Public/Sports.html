    <h1>My Top 3 Favorite Sports</h1>
    <ol>
       <h2><li>Gymnastics</li></h2>
       <p>I did competitive gymnastics for about 13 years, even with a fractured back and multiple sprains. After I was done compeiting, I continued to be involved in the sport by coaching younger children and keeping up with my practice</p>
       <h2><li>Dance</li></h2>
       <p>Like I had mentioned in my hobbies page, being a former hip hop, jazz, and lyrical dancer, I love dancing for fun! I enjoy trying all different types of dancing</p>
       <h2><li>Beach Volleyball</li></h2>
       <p>What a fun sport to do with a large group of people! There is no better feeling than being on a warm beach, playing a fun sport.</p>
